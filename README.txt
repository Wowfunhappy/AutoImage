A native cocoa app for using the excellent (if a tad expensive) `gpt-image-1` API. Add an OpenAI API Key, type in what you want to create, and press "Create Image"!

Open the gorgeous little side drawer to attach a reference image or change the output size and quality.

Tested on OS X 10.9; should work back to 10.6. Probably works on modern macOS too, it's simple enough that it should be forwards compatible.

This is another entirely "vibe coded" app, made in about half a day. Please don't actually read the code, I'm sure it's bad. However, I'm really happy with how the actual app came together, it feels super polished! The simple scope is a great match for what AI can do, and it's great to have a native Cocoa client that opens in milliseconds.
